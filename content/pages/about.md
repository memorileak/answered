## Hi, I'm the author of this site!

I'm a developer. Work is quite busy, but not always. In my free time, I often learn something new. Things I read, knowledge I got, I gathered them on this website. 

The articles are written from my personal perspective and thoughts. Not everything I write is always accurate and objective. If you find them interesting, please read them for reference purposes only.

Thanks for visiting!
